## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Currently, I am a **Research Fellow** at the [ISISLab](https://www.isislab.it) (**HPC Group**), part of the **University of Salerno**, Italy. My research spans from **embedded systems** and **cyber-physical systems (CPS)** to **RISC-V architectures** and **high-performance computing (HPC)**.

My current focus is on the [**LibreRT** project]([https://www.isislab.it](https://librert.di.unisa.it/)), where I contribute to the **design and deployment of real-time applications** on embedded CPUs and GPUs. I work on developing portable software stacks that support responsiveness, determinism, and performance across heterogeneous platforms.

Previously, during my master's at **Shahid Beheshti University**, I developed formal modeling frameworks for **self-aware cyber-physical systems** using **SystemC**, bridging simulation with real-time robotic co-design.

I am also engaged in performance analysis, real-time computing models, and RISC-V vector extensions for energy-efficient computation.
